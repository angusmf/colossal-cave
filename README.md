=============

I have always wanted to write an object-oriented version of Colossal Cave that normal people like me could understand, and this is that ongoing effort. This code had it's start somewhere back in 2009. I met a colleague at Starbuck's for a code kata - the rules being that all code had to be developed using strict TDD. And from that night I had the beginnings of the console input code. 

For the most part, I have maintained the use of TDD. Unfortunately, the project had big setback when I accidentally lost about 1000 unit tests for the parser. I am slowly trying to recreate those.
